# UberDrive
There are two files attached to it. One is the CSV file which contain the data for Uber travel between two places and miles between them. 
Along with that, there is a python file which has some questions related to the csv file, which I have solved them using python libraries. 
Try opening the python file with Jupyter Notebook.
Incase you have recently downloaded Jupyter, and cant use the libraries, go to command promt and install all the libraries.
Major libraried used are numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.
